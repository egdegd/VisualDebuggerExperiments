Task1
not to the end of the list algo goes i seen it from debuger
Task2
j != k, i seen it from debuger
Task3
need to add if (count >= total) break;, but very hard to find where.
Task4
very annoying, no need to +1 in -> and top direction
Task5
very helpful
Task6
very cool animation with circle

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?

 	circle of linked list. and 2d array nice

 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.

 	yes when 2 arrows go to each other. also when indices are shifted by 1

 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?

 	yes now i am just watching pictures instead of thinking and reading code

 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
