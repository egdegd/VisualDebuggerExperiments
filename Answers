Task1
The iteration runs up to index 7 while the array has length 9 thus 8 indexes.
Task2

Task3
There isn't any check for count variable to see if it has printed 16 times or not at the end.

Task4

Task5
Update the end list (the one with biggest value) 's .prev pointer to the inserted smaller value list
Task6


Rate your agreement with the following statements on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree):

	1.	The visualizations helped me understand the algorithm’s logic more quickly.
7
	2.	It was easier to find the bug using the Visual Debugger than with a standard debugger.
6
	3.	The plugin’s interface was clear and easy to use.
6
	4.	The highlighted elements (like indices or current node) were useful for following the program flow.
7
	5.	The diagrams reflected the code behavior accurately.
7
	6.	I felt more confident in my debugging process with the Visual Debugger.
7
	7.	The tool reduced my cognitive load compared to traditional debugging.
7
	8.	I would like to use this tool when learning or teaching data structures.
7
	9.	I would recommend the Visual Debugger to my classmates or friends.

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
The visual indications for example current variable points to what linked list is extremely useful.
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
Not really.
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
Yes, it helps me see the pattern made by the code without knowing what the code is doing so i can see clearly the algorithm.
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
Naming the in-memory name e.g., Node@123. You can put that directly onto the visual of the linked list so that when we have distinctions between different linked lists.
