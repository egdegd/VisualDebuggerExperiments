Task1
Wrong range of the loop
Task2
The same number was counted twice
Task3
Need to check the value of total
Task4
The DP formula was wrong, no need to take maximum.
Task5
The previous pointer was missed when inserting the node

Task6
One extra step

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
    All features were good

 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
    Only once when many elements moved at the same time, it was hard to follow.

 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
    Yes, I focused more on the result of each line, not just reading the code.

 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
 	Add the animation and the ability to go back one step.
