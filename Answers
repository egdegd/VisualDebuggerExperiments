Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
    Visualisation of current indices on the arrays
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
    No
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
    Yes I can first run through the whole debug without understanding the code before to understand the algorithm
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
    Add all used variables to the diagram
