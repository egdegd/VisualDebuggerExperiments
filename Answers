Task1
the iteration didnt go through the whole array
Task2
the iteration made sure that j was inferior or equal compared to k but it should be onl inferior to k or else we will sum two times the same element
Task3

Task4

Task5
run out ot the time
the prev node wasnt well atttached to the real previous one
Task6

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
The fact that i can visualise the steps makes it easier
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
no, on the contrary
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
Not really, it was just easier to follow
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
 maybe just the capacity to return one step back
