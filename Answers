Task1
The outer loop didnt handle the comparaison of the two last elements(n-1 to n)
Task2
Changed i<=j to i<j
Task3
add if condition (total=count)
Task4
removed the last case
Task5
add current.prev = newNode
Task6

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
        the visualization made for the data structures
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
        No
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
        No, just added the visualization of the execution of the program which is very helpful and efficient rather than doing it on a paper
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
 	    All good.
