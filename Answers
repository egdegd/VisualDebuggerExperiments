Task1
the bug was in the for loop (n-1, it should have been n)
Task2
the bug was in the condition of while loop, it should have been j<k not j<=k

Task3

Task4

Task5

Task6
The bug was in the  for loop  it should have been lenght - rotation -1 instead of length - rotation

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
 	to have the visual representaiton of arrays and linked lists

 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
 	yes for the metrix it was not verz clear and confusing, maybe it was because it was my first time using visual debugger

 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
 	no

 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
 	I dont have any idea
