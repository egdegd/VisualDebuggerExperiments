Task1
tge loop was going one time less than it should
Task2
the second element in the tuple should not be equal to the third
Task3
we should check that count is less than total before each count
Task4
we only need to take dp[i-1][j-1]+1
Task5

Task6
there was one rotation less

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
    how the highlighted elements helped a lot.
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
    not really, it was very helpful.
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
    More or less yes, it was clearer were the error was and helped me see exactly were it was.
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
    I would like to know how it would show when working with many data structures at the same time.
