Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
seeing the whole strucure at any time and at the same place (it doesn't move)
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
no it was very clear and easy to understand intuitively
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
yes, without the tool i was reading the lines and trying to understand exactly what they were doing, and with the tool i was more trying to understand the general concept without putting effort in looking at details
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
no ideas
