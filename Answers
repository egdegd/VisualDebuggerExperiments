Task1
The loop was missing the last comparison, so two elements stayed unsorted.

Task2
The check allowed j and k to point to same index, fixed with j < k.

Task3
Print happened even when count already reached total.

Task4

Task5
Assign .prev pointer when inserting the new node.

Task6
The rotation loop didn’t finish all steps — one step was skipped.

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
 	Visualisation of lists was very helpful.

 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
    No, everything matched what I expected from the code.

 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
    Yes, I looked more at structure behavior and less at the code details.

 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
    Everything seems good.
