Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
        The fact that you can see the links between linked lists helps understand this complicated data structure
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
        Not really
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
        Yes it makes finding bugs faster
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
        Being able to see the value of other variables in the coe for example in the corner
