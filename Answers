Task1
the length of the code was not the correct size.
Task2
Try to erase also duplicates.
Task3
There was no break of the pattern for the last step of count.
Task4
Didn't find it.
Task5
The last step took 2 step behind instead of one step.
Task6
There is needed one more step.

Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
    The visualization of each step of the code.
 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
    No just the code itself
 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
     Yes because I could see more clearly how the algorithm works
 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
    I don't know. It seems fine.
