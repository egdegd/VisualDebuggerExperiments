Please answer the following questions briefly:

 	10.	What specific features of the Visual Debugger did you find most helpful?
    The arrows and steps helped me follow the logic better.

 	11.	Were there any moments where the visualization confused or misled you? Please describe.
    No

 	12.	Did the tool change the way you approached debugging or algorithm analysis? How?
    Yes, I could guess the error faster by watching how the code runs.

 	13.	What improvements would you suggest for future versions of the Visual Debugger?
