# Experiments for the Project "Visual Debugger"

In this project, you are given **6 programming problems**, each accompanied by an **implementation that contains a bug**. Your task is to identify and fix the bug in each implementation. A test case is provided for each problem, which currently produces an **incorrect result** due to the bug.

For some problems, you will use the **standard debugger** only. For others, you will be allowed to use both the **Visual Debugger** and the standard debugger.

We will measure both the **speed** and **accuracy** of bug identification and correction.  
Additionally, you will be asked to provide a **brief explanation** (a few sentences) of the bug for each problem.

At the end of the session, you will be asked to complete a short **questionnaire** about your experience.
